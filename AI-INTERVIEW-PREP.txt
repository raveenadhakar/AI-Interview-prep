H). Unique Features That Can Set You Apart
Most interview prep apps stop at Q&A. Here’s how you can go beyond existing tools:
"Nervousness Detector"
Uses webcam + AI to detect hesitation, eye movement, voice shakiness.
"Adaptive Difficulty Engine"
AI detects if you are struggling → lowers difficulty
If you’re doing well → harder questions appear automatically.
"Live Debug Coach"
If your code fails, AI explains the bug in plain English instead of just showing an error.
"Company-Specific Mock Interviews"
Trained on publicly available interview experiences of Google, Amazon, etc., so AI mimics their style.
"Post-Interview Improvement Roadmap"
After each mock session, AI gives a 7-day custom plan for improvement.
"Memory Mode"
AI remembers your past mistakes and re-tests you after a week to ensure you learned.
"Interview Room Mode" (Realistic Simulation)
A virtual environment with a timer, coding pad, and webcam to simulate the real interview vibe.
